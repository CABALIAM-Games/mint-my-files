# Mint-My-Files project

Participating at https://devpost.com/software/mint-my-files Filecoin / IPFS Hackathon

Next GEN Hybrid Web2/Web3 Platform making use of Wordpress CMS for Member Portal, and a variety of Web2 apps or Web3 Dapps that combined can be use to perform Original Documents storage and replace paper copies. 

Intended to be the Member Power interface, it Combines Web2 stack of Wordpress CMS, MySQL Databases and MongoDB, with Blockchain Web3 stack using Tatum for multi blockchain communications, ProvenDB used for storage of Files authenticity , Filecoin/IPFS storage of large original files, SmartContract and Minted Files Interaction using a variety of Languages and Client Interfaces.

Uses Wordpress PayPal payments integration and Javascript Web3 Blockchain REST API (TATUM) to interact with 20+ other Blockchains for payment and minting capabilities.

- The platform can be considered a Blockchain Box with a determined capacity you pay for when storing, retrieving or validating data.
- Original documents cannot be modified, however, they can be timestamped, annotated, shared, archived
- Storage of Files on a Designated Filecoin/IPFS trusted Blockchain is possible if required by the solution
- Platform backend allow to pay for the service using PayPal using Wordpress integration.
- Platform backend allows to make conversion and pay using Bitcoin, Ethereum, Filecoin, and others Cryptocurrencies. 
- Files, Files Checksum, files metadata, short texts or programming flags are saved and minted on a variety of Blockchain and Traditional technologies
- Mint my site adds a feature to Download a copy of a website on a compressed File and generates a Checksum signature that can be used later as proof of ownership, copyrights, or other applications.
- APPS and DAPPs to perform validations and operations on the minted files can be written in any language and implement different workflows based on the SmartContrac or platform features offered once a document has been minted.
- The concept of Workflows offer a predetermined set of actions to perform on a file. One example could be a special event ticket/token minted , a Workflow could be used to Scan, Validate the Scan Against the Original, Burn the token or Write a flag somewhere to expire the validity of the Minted file.  Another sample is providing ID for opening a bank account: Share the minted ID cards, the bank access the shared file and executes the validation SmartContract , the Share is destroyed.
- Oracles of Information from Real world are made available through private blockchains using Filecoin/IPFS and Custom solutions
- Oracles of Information from Private companies are made available through private blockchains and Custom solutions
